>### Preface

> Standard D20 crafting rules base crafting times upon the market price of the items being created. This results in weird and unheroic gameplay outcomes. For instance, gold armour takes months longer to make than steel armour, even though gold is easier to work with. Or, a legendary swordsmith PC might have to take a couple of years off adventuring just to forge a greatsword from unique materials. Contrast how a caster can brew potions in a matter of hours, and creates magic items in mere days. 

> The goal of these rules is not to simulate perfectly realistic crafting times, just to make crafting time related to the material, complexity, and size of the item being crafted, and to make crafting a rewarding character option. Not everything has changed; most facets of these rules are likely to be familiar. Rather than overhaul the entire crafting system, this homebrew aims at modifying and expanding the existing mechanics. This guide is not comprehensive, and stands best as a supplement to a more complete D20 ruleset.
 
# Crafting

The basic process of crafting involves paying the raw material cost, determining the project's Crafting Value (CV), then making daily progress checks to increase the project's Progress Value (PV). When the PV equals or exceeds the CV, the item is complete.

For large projects, the DM may require that separate key components are crafted as separate items.

## Raw Materials

To calculate raw material cost, simply halve the market price of the item you’re creating. If there is no market price, ask the DM to come up with one. You generally need a plausible source for the raw materials, (e.g. you can't buy 500g worth of bronze whilst camping in the wilderness, and the local village probably won't have mithril ore). Additionally, small economies are generally only capable of providing a certain amount of raw materials based on the size of their economy, so consider the logistics behind big projects and large scale crafting.

With DM approval, raw materials might be able to be sourced via alternative methods: perhaps harvested by the PCs during downtime, purchased in bulk from an industrial supplier or kingdom, or perhaps collected via adventures.

## Crafting Value (CV)

The first step in crafting an item is determining its CV: an item’s CV describes how much work is required to make it. This figure is derived from the material, complexity, and size of the item. 
 
    CV = (Material Modifier) x (Complexity DC) x (Size Modifier) 
 
## Material Modifier

Some materials are easy to work with, some are difficult, and some require extreme treatment to be worked upon at all. **Table 1.1** (below) categorises the ease of working with different materials, listing example materials and the respective material modifiers. 

Use the material modifier for the most complex element’s composition (e.g. a spear is considered to be ‘tough’ on account of the spearhead, even though it's mostly made of wood.) Rare, superior, and exotic materials typically fall into 1 category higher than mundane materials of similar composition.

**Table 1.1: Material Modifiers**

Material|Modifier|Examples
:--|--:|:--
Pliable|2|Clay, cloth, paper
Workable|4|Wood, bone, hide, leather, aranea silk
Tough|8|Iron, bronze, gold, silver, lead, glass, darkwood, dragonhide
Resilient|16|Steel, stone, gems, adamantine, cold iron, mithril

## Complexity DC

Each item has a certain level of complexity in its design, and this complexity determines the difficulty of this item’s creation in terms of skill, whilst also affecting how long it takes to make. See **Table 1.2** for different complexity levels with examples and corresponding Complexity DC rating.  This table doesn't grant the ability to craft items beyond the technology level of the setting of the game. 

**Table 1.2: Item Complexity**
 
Complexity|DC|Examples|
:--|--:|:--
Extremely Simple|5| Casting plaster, carved one-piece items, clubs, quarterstaffs, slings.
Simple|10| Light armour, wooden shields, iron kitchenware, carts, rafts, most simple weapons (not crossbows).
Normal|15| Acid, cement, grease, weapon oil, lamp oil, ink, dye, medium armour, steel shields, simple adventuring gear, chariots, rowboats, sleighs, wagons, martial weapons and crossbows.
Complex|20|Black powder, glue, solvent, alchemist’s fire, flash powder, invisible ink, short-range paper fireworks, smokesticks, tindertwigs, cold iron (from ore), heavy armour, jewelry, skill toolkits, locks, complicated adventuring gear, traps CR 1–5, carriages, gliders, keelboats, longships, early firearm ammunition, early one-handed firearms, early two-handed firearms, exotic weapons.
Intricate|25|Smokeless gunpowder, antitoxin, itching powder, liquid ice, pellet grenade, rockets, aerial fireworks, smelling salts, sneezing powder, sunrods, tanglefoot bags, thunderstones, clocks, traps CR 6–10, multiple masted sailing ships, advanced firearm ammunition, advanced firearms, nonalchemical and nonfirearm siege weapons.
Very Intricate|30|Rusting powder, explosives, traps CR 11–15, pocket watches, airships, alchemical siege engines, siege firearms.
Extremely Intricate|35|Vaccines, traps CR 16+, alchemical dragons, steam giants, mechanical flying machines, steam engines, gearboxes.

###Prototypes
With DM approval, technological innovations beyond the level that exist in the game world can be developed by building a prototype. This prototype requires triple raw material costs and triple the standard CV of an item of it's type to create. Additionally, daily progress checks are made against a complexity DC one level higher than for the item being developed. The end result is a prototype of the desired item which is fragile, unstable, improperly sized, or otherwise impractical to use. Once the prototype has been created, new items of that type can be created. Alternatively, for same CV of creating a new item (but only half the standard raw material cost), the original prototype can be upgraded such that it no longer has prototype flaws. 

## Size Modifier
Tiny items between 1ft-2ft are the easiest to make in this system, as item gets smaller, it get’s fiddly and takes longer to make, whereas larger items take longer on account of more physical work. The modifier is different for small and medium sized crafters, based on the relative size of the items they work upon. When dimension and weight categories are in disagreement, the larger modifier applies.

**Table 1.3: Size modifier**

Size|Modifier (S/M crafter)|Dimensions|Weight
:--|--:|:--|:--
Smaller than Fine|4 / 8|1 in. or less|1/16 lb. or less
Fine|2 / 4|6 in. - 1 in.|1/8 lb. - 1/16 lb.
Diminutive|1 / 2|6 in. - 1 ft.|1/8 lb. - 1 lb.
Tiny|2 / 1|1 ft. - 2 ft.|1 lb. - 8 lb.
Small|4 / 2|2 ft. - 4 ft.|8 lb. - 60 lb.
Medium|8 / 4|4 ft. - 8 ft.|60 lb. - 500 lb.
Large|32 / 8|8 ft. - 16 ft.|500 lb. - 2 tons
Huge|64 / 32|16 ft. - 32 ft.|2 tons - 16 tons
Gargantuan|128 / 64|32 ft. - 64 ft.|16 tons - 125 tons
Colossal|256 / 128|64 ft. or more|125 tons or more

## Daily progress

At the beginning of each day, a crafter makes a crafting skill check to determine how much progress they make in crafting the item. They make a check against the Complexity DC of the item they’re working on. If successful, add the total result to the projects progress value (PV). If the check succeeds by 5, the accrued PV points equal twice the check result. If the check succeeds by 10 or more, it’s triple the check result in progress. 

Failing a daily progress check means that no progress is made that day. Failing by 5 deducts one quarter of the accrued PV. Failing by 10 deducts half of the accrued PV. Failing by 15 or more deducts all PV, destroying the project completely and requiring the crafter to start over; half of the required raw materials can be salvaged from the failed project, the other half will need to be acquired by the crafter to resume work.
 
If the crafter doesn’t have the required tools for their craft, they get -5 on their craft check. If they possess masterwork tools, they get +2. Some crafting skills require certain facilities (e.g. smithing requires a forge). 

#### Helpers
 
The crafter can receive a bonus from helpers, skilled and unskilled, so long as those helpers are fully occupied with helping for the entire duration of the work.  Unskilled helpers provide a +2 bonus to the crafter’s skill check each. Skilled helpers make their own craft checks and contribute towards project completion. The maximum number of helpers depends on their skill level, and the relative size of the item being produced. Small crafters are generally at an advantage here, which is why they’re favoured as artisans and slaves.

#### Working overtime

Normally, a crafter and their helpers spend 8 hours crafting for a full day’s work. Working for longer than follows the same rules for exhaustion by forced march, and grants no additional progress unless an additional 8 hours of work is completed (16 hours in total). Fatigued crafters earn half calculated progress (presuming they pass the daily progress check for the second 8 hour block), Fatigued helpers grant half their usual benefit (+1 instead of +2). Exhausted crafters and helpers grant no progress or benefit to the project whatsoever.
 
**Table 1.4: Maximum crafters and helpers per item size**

Item size|Max unskilled helpers (S/M)|Max skilled helpers (S/M)
:--|--:|--:
Smaller than Fine|0 / 0|0 / 0
Fine|0 / 0|0 / 0
Diminutive|0 / 0|0 / 0
Tiny|1 / 0|0 / 0
Small|2 / 1|1 / 0
Medium|4 / 2|1 / 1
Large|6 / 4|2 / 1
Huge|8 / 6|2 / 2
Gargantuan|10 / 8|3 / 2
Colossal|12 / 10|3 / 3
 
 
# Weapon and armour modifications

A piece of weaponry or armour can be given a modification with the relevant craft skill. Each piece of equipment can only have one modification applied at once, though modifications can be changed or removed with the appropriate craft skill. 
 
To make modifications, use the crafting rules above, but quarter the crafting value (CV) required to make the weapon or armour being modified: this is the CV for the modification. Then use the same crafting rules to find the Complexity DC for that item, and roll against it daily to accrue Progress Value (PV). The modification is complete when the PV equals or exceeds the modification's CV. Weapons and Armour are considered broken whilst modification work is in progress.
 
**Table 1.5: Weapon modifications**

\#|Modification|Description
:--|:--|:--
1|Reckless|+1 to damage, -1 to hit.
2|Balanced|+1 to hit, -1 to damage.

6|Bladed|Change melee damage type to slashing. Ranged weapon gains a melee slashing attack (1d6, x2).
7|Club-headed|Change melee damage type to bludgeoning. Ranged weapon gains a melee bludgeoning attack (1d6, x2).
8|Long|Melee weapon gains ‘brace’ and ‘reach’. Increase ranged weapon's range increment by half, rounding down. Weapon becomes two-handed if it wasn't already.
9|Hooked|Weapon gains ‘trip’. Ranged weapons can perform this manou
10|Pronged|Melee weapon gains ‘disarm’.
11|Padded|Melee weapon or ammunition deals nonlethal damage.
